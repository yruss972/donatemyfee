					<h3>What do you mean, donate my fee?</h3>
					<p>Everyone has a cause which is close to their heart. Whether it's a medical research group, or a school, or a charity, we all look for ways to help. Donating money and volunteering time are always an option but is that the best we can do?</p>
					<p>Unless you are independently wealthy, the financial aid you can provide is limited. Volunteering time is a better option but only if that time is put to the best possible use. If you're like me, and I believe like many professionals, your skills are your most valuable asset. A successful lawyer, for example, could volunteer his time serving food in a soup kitchen or offering his legal services. Obviously the latter option is a better use of his time but what if the soup kitchen has no need for legal services?</p>
					<p>This is the question I answered for myself when I started DonateMyFee. I was often approached for advice or small projects in my field but wasn't setup to give invoices for moonlighting gigs so I'd turn them away. Instead, I decided to accept but ask that the fees be paid directly to charity. It's a win-win approach, I explained. The company gets the job done and a tax deduction for the donation while I get to raise money for a good cause without the overhead of an accountant and income taxes.
					<h3>Why should you donate your fees?</h3> 
					<ul>
					<li>Raise 30-50% more money than if you would donate from your net income, after taxes, operating overhead, your employer's profit, etc.</li>
					<li>Raise awareness for your charity by introducing your potential clients to your preferred cause.</li>
					<li>Expand your professional horizons by accepting projects you wouldn't normally accept.</li>
					</ul>
