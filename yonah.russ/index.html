                <h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
                <p>You get my services just as you would if you paid me
                directly but with the added benefit of a tax deduction for your
                donation.</p>

                <h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
                <p>It's simple math. By getting you to donate my fee directly
                to charity, I can raise 30-50% more money than I could if I
                donated my net income after taxes.</p>

                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>I began working as a Linux sysadmin about 27 years ago.
                Around then I started learning how to code in PERL and build
                websites in HTML 3. Since then, I've managed to dig my thumbs
                into many different pies including pretty much anything
                requiring secure, highly available, high performance,
                UNIX/Linux based services. Lately, I've specialized in DevOps
                including the automated deployment of development and
                production infrastructure for high performance distributed
                services in the cloud.</p>

                <h3>ELIYA - Association for blind and visually impaired
                children</h3>
                <p>ELIYA runs programs to help blind or visually impaired
                children from 6 months to 6 years old, and their families.
                Their expert staff of teachers, therapists, and assistants with
                their decades of experience have helped many including my own
                daughter to close the developmental gaps between themselves and
                other children their ages. They give them the tools and
                confidence to overcome their disadvantages.</p>
                <p>As a parent, I've seen, first hand, the tremendous growth
                the ELIYA can foster. It's nothing short of miraculous. At the
                same time, I've seen the lengths to which the staff of ELIYA
                go, in order to stretch what funding they have to the limits.
                The toys and tools which visually impaired children need are
                not the ones we all find at the local Toys R' Us. They are
                specialized, very well thought out pieces of equipment which
                are bought by very few and therefore sold at a premium. As a
                result, ELIYA builds much of the equipment and toys in
                house.</p>
                <p>ELIYA has tax deductible entities in <a href=
